## It really depends on who is reviewing

- PR strategies are best discussed with your team
- larger PRs maybe acceptable due to much higher understanding of the code
- refactoring is understood and can lead to large PRs

---

## Increases understandability

- usually
- badly written code isn't made more understandable if it's done in small PRs
- well written code makes it easy to understand to outsiders

---

## Faster and better feedback

- less lines to read means there's less to check (obviously...)
