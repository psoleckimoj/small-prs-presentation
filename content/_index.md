## Why small PRs?

- depends on your team
- increases understandibility (usually) 
- faster and better feedback
- break less, easier to spot bugs
- focus on one change

## It really depends on who is reviewing

- PR strategies are best discussed with your team
- larger PRs maybe acceptable due to much higher understanding of the code
- refactoring is understood and can lead to large PRs

---

## Increases understandability

- usually
- badly written code isn't made more understandable if it's done in small PRs
- well written code makes it easy to understand to outsiders
- large PRs are daunting if you don't know the code, possibly having to check out the project to understand the context for the PR

---

## Faster and better feedback

- less lines to read means there's less to check (obviously...)
- smaller problems are easier to understand
- takes less time to check and hence can write more meaningful feedback

---

## One change

- stick to one problem
- push other changes you need to make into separate PRs unless they abosolutely cannot

---

## Bug spotting

- again, less code, tend to pay more attention
- less lines so bugs tend to be more obvious

## My experience

- some people will refuse to merge large PRs
- very dependent on your team, can be more forgiving
- took me a while to stop and break out other changes when doing a ticket, i.e. updating a module and it's methods
